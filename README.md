# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

## 📌 Description
This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built with **Python**, **Pandas**, **NLTK**, and **Scikit-learn**.  
It recommends movies similar to a given movie by analyzing their **genres**, **keywords**, and **overviews**, using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

The dataset used is `movies.csv` with over **4,800 movies** and 24 features.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 Loads and preprocesses a dataset of movies.
- 📝 Combines genres, keywords, and overviews into a single content string.
- 🧹 Cleans text by removing stopwords, special characters, and converting to lowercase.
- 🔤 Converts movie content into TF-IDF vectors.
- 📊 Calculates similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.
- 🎯 Returns top N similar movies for a given title.
- ☁ Generates a **WordCloud** for visualizing common terms.
